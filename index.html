          My name is Sabrina and I graduated last year from University of
          Michigan with a BSE in Industrial Engineering. I currently work for
          the Commodities and Energy Team at Morningstar Inc, in downtown
          Chicago. I was born and raised in Guatemala City, Guatemala and moved
          to the United States to complete my undergraduate studies. The
          exposure that Iâ€™ve had to the Fin Tech industry, has encouraged me to
          want to pursue a future career in software engineering. I want to have
          the opportunity to join the Quantitative Research Team at Morningstar
          as a Quant Developer.

        <p class="aboutme">
          When I am not working or coding, I love exercising and spending time
          with my friends. I enjoy walking to North Avenue Beach in the
          afternoons or going to rooftops in the city to watch the sunset. I
          also love travelling and learning about different cultures abroad. My
          favorite destination besides Guatemala, has been Santorini, Greece. I
          also enjoy spending time with my dog and with my siblings.
